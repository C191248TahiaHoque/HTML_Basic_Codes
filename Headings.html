        Surah Al-Alaq was first revealed in the city of Makkah by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). It has five ayats mentioned, and the chapter stands at the 96th position in the Quran, and teaches Muslims to obey Allah in every situation in life. It states that He knows everything, and all that happens in life is the result of His planning. He is the most generous and has created the human from a clot.

    The scholars are divided on narrowing down the ayah that was last revealed by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Some believe that Ayat 281 of Surat Al-Baqarah is the last one. <br> <br>
    It states that when humans go back to Allah, every soul repays the debt of the sins they committed and earn rewards from Allah. After this, everyone gets fair treatment. <br> 
    Other scholars believe that Ayat 3 of Surah Al-Ma’idah is the last revealed by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). It says, “This day I have done your religion for you, complete my favour upon you, and have selected for you Islam as your religion.”
